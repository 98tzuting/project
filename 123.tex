The branching fraction and time-dependent CP asymmetry of $B^0 \rightarrow J/\psi \eta$ are studied. The goal of this study is to measure the CP asymmetry parameters $S$ and $A$ by performing an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the $\Delta t$ distribution. The signal event and background studies are performed in this note.
